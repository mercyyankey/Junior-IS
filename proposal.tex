\title{\textbf{Bridging Understanding to Speaking: A Language Learning Application for African Heritage Speakers}}
\author{Mercy Yankey}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

Heritage speakers of under-researched African languages often demonstrate strong listening comprehension while struggling with spontaneous language production. Many individuals raised in multilingual households can understand conversations fluently but lack confidence, vocabulary access, or grammatical control when speaking. This gap is particularly evident among heritage speakers of languages such as Twi, where formal instructional resources are limited and language learning is often informal, inconsistent, and orally transmitted.

This project proposes the design of a language-learning application tailored to African heritage speakers, beginning with Twi. The goal of the application is to support the transition from comprehension to active language production by combining structured lessons, gamified practice, narrative-based learning, and low-effort review tools. By offering multiple learning pathways, the system aims to accommodate diverse cognitive styles, attention levels, and learning preferences while addressing the specific challenges faced by heritage language learners.
