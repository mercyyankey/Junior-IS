% Here is an example of how to create a bibliography entry for an article using

% provided by most web sites that allow you to export citations. The string
% "clrsAlgorithms" is a citation key, and if you were citing the source in a

annote = {Revitalising the Irula Language Through Mobile Language Learning Application examines the use of a mobile-assisted language learning (MALL) system to support the preservation of the endangered Irula language. The authors identify language shift, social discrimination, and declining interest among younger generations as the primary causes of the language’s endangerment. To address this issue, the study focuses on the design and development of an Android-based language learning application intended to promote autonomous learning and cultural engagement.

The authors employ a mixed-methods approach, beginning with the collection of secondary language data and following an Agile software development paradigm. The program features a multilingual English–Tamil interface and is developed on React Native to facilitate cross-platform deployment. Audio pronunciation, sample sentences, and grammatical explanations are essential components that support learners in making judgments during vocabulary learning and practice.

The system is evaluated through exploratory testing on six Android and iOS devices to assess performance and responsiveness. An optimized search algorithm with delay functionality reduces latency and improves usability. Based on Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) principles, user feedback indicates that the audiovisual elements and interface design are well received, while also identifying areas for future improvement. This source is relevant to research on decision-making in language learning systems because it demonstrates how computational design choices and evaluation metrics influence learner engagement, accessibility, and system effectiveness.},

abstract = {Domestic undergraduate computer science students formally learn about machine learning and artificial intelligence in upper level undergraduate computing programs, yet they must navigate the lure of ChatGPT and other generative Artificial Intelligence tools that have been found to be somewhat accurate at completing early coding assignments. As AI tools proliferate, messaging about their use in academic settings are varied, and access to AI literacy is unknown. Through an investigation of interviews with Pell grant eligible college students at open access colleges, we address the following research questions: How do low-income undergraduate interview participants describe their uses of and attitudes regarding generative AI tool use for academic purposes? and What elements of AI digital literacy appear to be accessible to interview participants, based on their descriptive statements?},
