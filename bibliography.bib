annote = {Revitalising the Irula Language Through Mobile Language Learning Application examines the use of a mobile-assisted language learning (MALL) system to support the preservation of the endangered Irula language. The authors identify language shift, social discrimination, and declining interest among younger generations as the primary causes of the language’s endangerment. To address this issue, the study focuses on the design and development of an Android-based language learning application intended to promote autonomous learning and cultural engagement.

The authors employ a mixed-methods approach, beginning with the collection of secondary language data and following an Agile software development paradigm. The program features a multilingual English–Tamil interface and is developed on React Native to facilitate cross-platform deployment. Audio pronunciation, sample sentences, and grammatical explanations are essential components that support learners in making judgments during vocabulary learning and practice.

The system is evaluated through exploratory testing on six Android and iOS devices to assess performance and responsiveness. An optimized search algorithm with delay functionality reduces latency and improves usability. Based on Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) principles, user feedback indicates that the audiovisual elements and interface design are well received, while also identifying areas for future improvement. This source is relevant to research on decision-making in language learning systems because it demonstrates how computational design choices and evaluation metrics influence learner engagement, accessibility, and system effectiveness.},

  annote = {Investigating the Effects of Extended Reality (XR) on Interpreter Competencies: An Experimental Study of a Pioneering XR Mobile-Assisted Language Learning Application for Interpreting Training explores how extended reality technology can enhance interpreter training through a mobile-assisted language learning (MALL) system. The authors argue that real-world situations and visual cues are essential for developing professional interpreting competencies, yet are often absent from traditional classroom-based instruction. To address this limitation, the study presents an XR-based mobile learning application designed to support blended and immersive learning environments.


The authors employ a quasi-experimental research design involving an experimental group and a control group over a ten-week period. The XR MALL system integrates learning resources, video demonstrations, virtual reality (VR) practice, and augmented reality (AR) vocabulary features, enabling learners to engage in immersive and interactive interpreting scenarios. Learners’ interpreting knowledge and practical skills are evaluated using pre- and post-study interpreting tasks, allowing the system to track changes in performance over time.




The findings indicate that participants in the XR MALL program demonstrate significantly greater improvements in both declarative knowledge of interpreting and practical interpreting techniques than the control group. This source is relevant to research on decision-making in language learning systems because it demonstrates how computational learning environments can influence learner performance, guide skill development, and evaluate competency through structured experimental assessment methods.}

abstract = {Domestic undergraduate computer science students formally learn about machine learning and artificial intelligence in upper level undergraduate computing programs, yet they must navigate the lure of ChatGPT and other generative Artificial Intelligence tools that have been found to be somewhat accurate at completing early coding assignments. As AI tools proliferate, messaging about their use in academic settings are varied, and access to AI literacy is unknown. Through an investigation of interviews with Pell grant eligible college students at open access colleges, we address the following research questions: How do low-income undergraduate interview participants describe their uses of and attitudes regarding generative AI tool use for academic purposes? and What elements of AI digital literacy appear to be accessible to interview participants, based on their descriptive statements?},
